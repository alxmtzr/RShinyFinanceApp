# Finance Tracking Shiny App
> Work in progress.

## Overview

This Shiny app allows users to track and visualize financial transactions. Users can input a specific month and year to view both outgoing and incoming transactions for that period.

## Features

- **Date Selection**: Use the date picker to select a specific month and year.
- **Tabs for Outgoing and Incoming Transactions**: Separate tabs display outgoing and incoming transactions for the selected month.
- **Tables with Details**: View detailed information about transactions, including payer, recipient, reason for transfer, and amount.
- **Graphical Representation (Optional)**: [Optional] View graphical representations of financial data using additional tabs.

## Usage

1. **Prepare Your Data**: Ensure your financial data is exported from Deutsche Kreditbank AG (DKB) in CSV format.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Before running the Shiny app, you can use the provided R script to clean your CSV file. The script, named `clean_data.R`, is located in the project directory. You have to adjust the path to your csv file in `line 5`:
```r
df = read_csv2("/PATH/TO/CSV-FILE")
```
Execute the script to clean and transform your data. The cleaned data will be saved automatically as `data_cleaned.csv` in the `csv` folder.

3. The CSV file should include columns for `booking_date`, `payer`, `recipient`, `reason_for_transfer`, `in_out`, and `amount_euro`.
4. **Run the Shiny App**: Open RStudio and set the working directory to the root of the cloned repository. Run the Shiny app using the following command in the R console:

    ```r
    shiny::runApp()
    ```

5. **Explore Your Finances**: The app will launch in your default web browser. Use the date picker to select a specific month and year. Navigate between tabs to view outgoing and incoming transactions.
